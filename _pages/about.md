Hi, happy to see you here!
I am Temulun and my research is in health economics and empirical industrial organization. I use causal inference methods and structural models to study decision-making in healthcare. Currently, I am trying to understand how patients influence healthcare delivery and provider behavior in the context of primary care. I also study how competitive pressures can shape treatment decisions. I have been working mostly with large-scale data on claims, prescriptions, and demographics, and have experience processing text and geodata. Before starting my PhD in Economics at [Berlin School of Economics](https://berlinschoolofeconomics.de/home) / [DIW Berlin](https://www.diw.de/) in October 2020 and moving to Berlin, I received my master's degree in Economics from [CEMFI](https://www.cemfi.es/index.asp), Madrid.
Besides work, I am also interested in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, human languages, and photography (alphabetically ordered).
