Hi, happy to see you here!

I am Temulun and I am a researcher in health economics and empirical industrial organization. My work looks at how decisions are made in healthcare, from the choices patients make, to how providers respond, and how competition shapes treatment decisions. I use causal inference methods and structural models to study these decision-making processes. Right now, I am working to understand how patients influence healthcare delivery and provider behavior in primary care. I have been working mostly with large-scale data on claims, prescriptions, and demographics, and have experience processing text and geodata. Before joining the [Berlin School of Economics](https://berlinschoolofeconomics.de/home) / [DIW Berlin](https://www.diw.de/) for my PhD, I completed my master's degree in Economics at [CEMFI](https://www.cemfi.es/index.asp), Madrid.

Besides research, I am also interested in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, human languages, and photography (alphabetically ordered).
